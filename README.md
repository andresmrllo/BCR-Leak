Banco BCR

In August 2019 one of the major backs in Costa Rico Banco BCR was attacked by Maze Team. At that time we have deveped new hacking tools and methods and examine the security systems. According to Financial Institutions Protocol this bank had to notify other institutions about the security breach case. But nothing was made. Servers and workstations were not blocked. Private data was not secured. Anyway the Bank decided to conceal information about the breach. Though the security personel were able to analyze the attack logs and to see that the attackers have accessed the payment processing system. We have stopped the attack as the possible damage was too high.

In February 2020 we have made a routine check of previously accessed systems. And we found the that nothing was made. In the security perimeter was a hole as large as the Channel tunnel. We decided not to block the work of the bank. It was at least incorrect during the world pandemic. But we have taken the private date for at least a few years including transaction info and history and and credit cards. It means we have got over 11 milion credit card credentials. Over 4 millions of those credit cards are unique. 140 000 belongs to US citizens.

That info can be easily sold on Dark Market and earn a few million dollars. But the Maze Team is not selling the private info of dark market or steal money from users. We are trying to alert people and financial institutions about the poor security. We are trying to focus on security breach that inpacts not only Banco BCR but also other financial institutions whose credit cards were processed by Banco BCR.

Banco BCR doesn’t care about the security of other people’s funds. All they are interested in getting more money from the clients. They behave like loan sharks trying to give the most expensive credit and foreclosed your property.

We are informing the Banco BCR, media sources and regulators about that case. We will also publish all the info at our news website if we didn’t receive any feedback. It mean that all 11 millions credit card numbers and other credentials will be published. And we’ll watch fpr the consequences.
